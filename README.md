HOW TO PUT A QUOTE EVERY TIME YOU OPEN A NEW TERMINAL

1-Put the file "terminal_wikiquote_webbot.py" in your HOME directory

2-Open a new terminal and in the HOME directory open this file:

gedit .bashrc

Don't change the file, just add a new line at the end of the file that execute the program and the quote keywords, one example:

python3 terminal_wikiquote_webbot.py Terry Pratchett

Every time you'll open a new terminal, the program will show a random quote based in the given keywords

You can also put a mix of different search quotes, just put commas between the different theme quote. As an example:

python3 terminal_wikiquote_webbot.py Terry Pratchett, Asimov

The terminal will put a random quote about Terry Pratchett or Asimov
